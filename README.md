# Rhode Island SeaGrant Larval Stress Exposure 

Experiment date: Summer 2022  

In the exposure experiment, there were three replicate spawning blocks, labeled B2, B3, B4. Before exposure, four samples were collected for genomic processing (T0). Larvae were reared in a ambient (CB) treatment or a stress (HB) treatment. Ambient conditions were filtered seawater from Narragansett Bay. The stress treatment was a diel-cycling of pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) with ambient conditions during the day, cycling down to a pH of 7.0 and DO of 1.5 mg/L over night. There were three replicates per treatment. At the end of each exposure period, larval samples were collected for each bucket. 

Samples were processed following the Expressed Exome Capture Sequencing protocol. All bioinformatic analyses will be documented here.
